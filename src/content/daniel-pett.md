Dan has worked in museums and heritage for 2 decades and until recently was Head of Major Projects (Digital Strategy) for Historic England. 
He is now Director of Digital Strategy and Operations for Westminster School and he also has held the roles of Digital Humanities Lead at the British Museum, where he 
designed and implemented digital innovation connecting humanities research, museum practice, and the creative industries; 
ICT Advisor to the Portable Antiquities Scheme and Head of Digital and IT for the Fitzwilliam Museum. In doing so, he has 
created extensive cross-disciplinary and cross-sector networks. 

Dan’s first major project at the British Museum was to design and build the award winning Portable Antiquities Scheme 
database (which holds records of over 1.6 million objects) and enabled collaboration through projects working on linked 
and open data (LOD) with ISAW NYU and the American Numismatic Society, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding (MicroPasts), 
and developing the British Museum’s 3D capture reputation. He led the British Museum's 3D work with Thomas Flynn and Jennifer 
Wexler and whilst at the Fitzwilliam Museum he revived their faded digital reputation and led the development of their new website,
collections systems, 3d capture, CRM and ticketing and IT infrastructure. He is an advocate of open access, open source and reproducible
research.

Daniel is Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, London and the Royal Geographical Society. He holds Honorary posts at 
Stirling University, UCL's Institute of Archaeology and the Centre for Digital Humanities and publishes regularly in the 
fields of museum studies, archaeology and digital humanities and writes too much code.
