The Egypt Exploration Society (EES) is a leading organization dedicated to the study and preservation of Egypt's rich archaeological heritage. As a partner in the MicroPasts project, the EES collaborated to crowdsource and co-produce open data related to their extensive archives. This initiative enabled the digitization and wider accessibility of historical records, fostering community engagement and advancing research in Egyptology.
