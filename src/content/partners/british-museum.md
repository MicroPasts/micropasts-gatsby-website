The British Museum is one of the world's most renowned cultural institutions, dedicated to human history, art, and culture. As a partner in the MicroPasts project, the British Museum contributed to the development of innovative 3D masking techniques for artifact modeling and supported the transcription of the Bronze Age Index. These efforts have enhanced the accessibility and preservation of historical data, enabling researchers and the public to engage with the museum's extensive collections in new and meaningful ways.
